HOLY BOOK THAT HELPED ME WITH ALL OF THIS: https://dev.to/lavikara/setup-vue-webpack-and-babel-boo


1.) Issues emerged with newest webpack versions not being compatible with webpack-dev-server.
Reason for that is that NO MORE dev server with newer webpacks, these links helped a lot with fixing that:

2.) CSS loader cannot use both "style-loader" and MiniCssExtractPlugin.loader together. It drops a fuck ton of errors.
So I have to chose one of that two.
More about it can be read about here: https://stackoverflow.com/a/64320105/4267429


3.) Postcss-loader also has changes where it says that "options" property has new way of assining to it.

4.) In optimization part of webpack.config > moduleIds: "hashed" - has been depricated.
So we use: > moduleIds: "deterministic" - now.
