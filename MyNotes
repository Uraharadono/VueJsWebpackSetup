HOLY BOOK THAT HELPED ME WITH ALL OF THIS: https://dev.to/lavikara/setup-vue-webpack-and-babel-boo


1.) Issues emerged with newest webpack versions not being compatible with webpack-dev-server.
Reason for that is that NO MORE can we use same command as before "webpack-dev-server", we have to rather use "serve" :

2.) CSS loader cannot use both "style-loader" and MiniCssExtractPlugin.loader together. It drops a fuck ton of errors.
So I have to chose one of that two.
More about it can be read about here: https://stackoverflow.com/a/64320105/4267429


3.) Postcss-loader also has changes where it says that "options" property has new way of assining to it.

4.) In optimization part of webpack.config > moduleIds: "hashed" - has been depricated.
So we use: > moduleIds: "deterministic" - now.

5.) In case I want to include something from bootstrap that I have failed up until now on my own, I can find some help here:
- https://code.luasoftware.com/tutorials/vuejs/setup-bootstrap-with-vue-cli-3-webpack/  (for usage if javascript functionalities)
- https://code.luasoftware.com/tutorials/vuejs/vuejs-import-bootstrap-scss/ (just css)
- https://code.luasoftware.com/tutorials/vuejs/setup-bootstrapvue-with-vue-cli/


6.) For determining api route globally, I have used this as example:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38164102/change-hard-coded-url-constants-for-different-environments-via-webpack

but had issues with webpack not being defined, so this helped with it:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31592819/referenceerror-webpack-is-not-defined

7.) For auth stuff, take a look at this solution: https://jasonwatmore.com/post/2018/07/06/vue-vuex-jwt-authentication-tutorial-example
This seems like a nice way to handle things.
